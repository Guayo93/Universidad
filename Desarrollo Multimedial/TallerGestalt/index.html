							<h4>Positive Mindfulness!</h4>
							<p>There seems to be a new buzz word out there among people in all walks of life. Mindfulness... in simple terms, it has to do with being in the moment. It seems we are a society of multi-taskers. Are we doing so many things at one time that we are
								not really paying attention to what we are doing? This conjures up images of a person going around and around in circles. A never ending cycle to the daily treadmill. Between technology demands, and teens thinking that texting is actually having
								a conversation, are we evolving into a people who can not be content with just one-person-to-one-person conversation and interface? I am not a cynic, (someone who has negative opinions about other people and about the things people do; especially;
								a person who believes that people are selfish and are only interested in helping themselves.). However, lately I have experienced some technological challenges, (as evidenced in this "stalled" website, which is now still in the process of cautiously
								being upgraded, but functioning once again) but I don't think it has jaded me to technology! However, there are those who are jaded to positive mindfulness and thought processes. The Nay-Sayers, or as I like to call them the Negative Nillies...they
								are the cynics of the world. In this political year we are bombarded with them everywhere! How can you find any peace and contentment in that atmosphere? No, I don't think you run from the issues. I just think you need to be mindful (there is
								that word again)... mindfulness in what words are coming our of you mouth, that can never be "taken back." Once spoken, how do you stop them from resonating in your ears? Mindfulness in what actions you are taking. Once a decision is made and
								done, can it be reversed? Face it, all of the Negative Nillies of the world can overload your thought process, if you let them. Don't embrace them and their dark cloud of influence. Isn't is better to find the graciousness and kindness in the
								world? Isn't it true you find what you seek? If you look for the negative in the world, it is there. If you look for the positive and kindness in the world, it is there too! It is a choice! No, I am not "Pollyanna" and no, I am not wearing "rose-colored"
								glasses. I am flawed, horribly flawed, and so are my dear friends, but don't we accept our friends, "warts and all?' Again, it is a choice! I mindfully make my choice to be positive! So I am celebrating positive mindfulness! And with that being
								stated, I invite you all to attend my last Spring Workshop for 2016, April 10th, Sunday afternoon 3-5 at the 'Emmet O'Neal library, I promise it will be a positive experience! Email or PM us on Facebook if you want more details. We already have
								several people pre-registered! It should be a positive experience, and hopefully you will find it mindfully uplifting! And more positive things have been in our mist lately. Recently I was contacted by Dorm DÃ©cor, and Swoozies to venture into
								some mutual advantages for our clients. Those should start to manifest themselves at our April 10th workshop! It is exciting to think about these new relationships! Also, another positive event, I have the distinct privilege of being the keynote
								speaker for Potential Magazine's overview of Greek life and the recruitment process on college campuses! That is April the 19th in Montgomery, Alabama. Potential Magazine is the publication headed and edited by Pam Mashburn. Pam and her crew are
								apt at educating parents and high schoolers on the prep process for college entrance. They navigate everything from applications, being admitted, scholarships, and beyond! I am honored to be a small part of what promises to be a positive and informative
								day! Stay positive folks!<br /><br /> All the best from Rushbiddies! Pat</p>

							<h4>SPRING 'EXTREME' WORKSHOP MARCH 15, 2015</h4>
							<p>I get hopeful this time of the year! (Even with the ice and snow still gathering!) Preview Saturday is coming up this weekend, February the 28th at the University of Alabama! My Bama girls are getting excited and filled with anticipation! To Bama's
								credit, this is a wonderful tool and introduction to the college sorority recruitment process! It helps the girls, just a bit, to demystify the expectations and recruitment procedures. Plus, it helps Moms and Dads to understand, a little better,
								about what is expected. This is why I feel our Spring workshops are so valuable! They aid and serve as a good follow-up to Preview weekend for the Bama girls! Plus, our workshops are invaluable to our girls heading off to other college campuses,
								(without a preview weekend). Our workshoppers start getting their minds around the prepartion necessary and needed for their specific campus sorority recruitment! Sorority recruitment takes commitment on several levels! First impressions really
								count...on every level! Our EXTREME workshop is spot-on in addressing where to begin in this process. After all these years, we have fine-tuned our materials to address the biggest questions and most pressing concerns! If you were not able to
								attend our Fall "Early Bird" workshop, you certainly do not want to miss this Spring's EXTREME workshop! There is much to do and preparation takes time! Come join us and bring us your concerns! We can't wait to see you all! Spring flowerbuds are
								on the cusp and so is your sorority recruitment! You have a chance to make this work for you -- make it count and let us help you 'cover' eveything! Don't just wait on the sunshine of success! Let us help make it happen for you!<br /> All the
								best!</p>

					Fall and "Early Bird" on the Horizon!!<br /> by Pat Grant on 10/11/14<br />

							<h4>Fall and "Early Bird" on the Horizon!!</h4>
							<p>It seems that everything revolves around the weather! We in the south can probably attribute that mind-set to the agrarian roots most native families share! Perhaps even many generations back! Late summer and early fall have rapidly expired! I
								am just waiting for the elusive "cool snap" to show up again! This is the winding down of my busiest time of the year! Thankfully, most of our Rushbiddies' girls have gotten placed. If they did not find their "spot" in formal recruitment, it seems
								that COB (continuous open bidding) has been a great option! Now they are all focused on football and all the campus activities involved! What a great time in their lives!!<br /> I know here in the south everyone is enjoying their SEC football!
								What a conference! I specifically plan my one and only fall "Early Bird" workshop to not conflict with football! After all, we are located in the deep South and the heart of the SEC. So many young ladies have come to southern schools to enjoy
								the traditions, the excitement, and the loyal fan-base so evident in the SEC! I completely understand the attraction!<br /> I am looking forward tomorrow's workshop! I always love meeting new Moms and daughters! They come so eager to get started
								with their recruitment prep and process! And in some cases, a bit anxious for the unknown! It is a wonderful chance to inform and build up the sweet young hearts of these beautiful young ladies! Plus help the endearing Moms acquire the tools they
								will both need to navigate the recruitment process! It is never too soon to start! The next "Open" group workshop will be our EXTREME Workshop in spring 2015! More about that later!<br /><br /> In the mean time, I smile thinking about tomorrow!</p>

							<h4>On the threshold of...</h4>
							<p> Hi all! It has been a busy but lovely spring! Warm, pleasant days quickly dissolving into hot, steamy days -- long before it is officially summer. These type of days are what we are known for in Alabama! Summer has arrived, even though the calendar
								has not reflected it just yet! School ending is a sure sign! Now that most schools have graduated their seniors and closed for slower summer activities, it is time for our college-bound PNMs to take stock of where they are in their sorority recruitment
								preparation! By now, if you are participating in a fall 2014 sorority recruitment, you should have all of your paperwork completed. Now is the time you organize and start delivering the packets to the alumnae, who will be writing your official
								recommendations. This is a strong first step, and one that should not be overlooked! I am always happy to help with any additional insight if questions should arise! I have said countless times, newly graduated seniors should consider this a summer
								of lists! Starting with writing all of those 'thank your' notes, a necessary sign of gratitude upon receiving a plethora of graduation gifts. Then there is the list of all the things needed to live comfortably in your college dorm. Oh, and then
								there are clothing additions? Not only is it what you will need to "dress for success" during sorority recruitment parties, but what to wear for orientation, etc. I could go on and on, but again I remind you, think of this as a summer of lists!
								However, I do hope you can take some of these slower summer days to sleep in a bit, spend some wonderful time with your family, but mostly to just breathe in the wonderful accomplish of a life milestone in graduating high school! You are truly
								on the threshold of some wonderful experiences that college can bring! Of course, my major concern is that you have an extraordinary sorority recruitment experience! Again, preparation is key! However, I do recognize that college holds an abundance
								of experiences (outside of sorority life) which can enrich your life! Organize your lists, but schedule some down-time too! This is an unique summer for new graduates. Upon graduation, you immediately become a college-bound freshman. There is
								such a sense of urgency in that, there really is no in-between! So savvier these summer days, draw strength from them and the years of accomplishment behind you. It is then that you can move ahead, embrace the change, and become even more self-aware
								to accomplish your personal goals! Blessings on you all! Congratulations graduates and may you have the best of everything during your college years and beyond!<br /> Many hugs! Pat</p>
